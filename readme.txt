= What should I do if I'm using the Cashfree Payments plugin on multiple WooCommerce domains and encounter duplicate order IDs? =

No worries, we've got a simple solution for you! If you're managing the Cashfree Payments plugin across multiple WooCommerce domains and you notice the possibility of duplicate order IDs due to sequential generation. To ensure a unique identification for orders originating from different domains, consider enabling the "Order ID Prefix" feature in the plugin's configuration settings.
Enabling the order ID prefix guarantees a seamless experience for you and your customers. By adding a unique prefix to each order ID, you'll effortlessly distinguish orders across your various domains.
Disabling the Enable Order Id Prefix after it's been enabled might break post-order flows. Consider the implications before making changes.
Please be mindful of the impact on your order management process before toggling this setting.
