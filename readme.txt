Official Cashfree Payment Gateway plugin for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

This is the official Cashfree Payment Gateway plugin for WooCommerce.

For more information about Cashfree Payments please go to https://cashfree.com.

== Installation ==

Please note, this payment gateway requires WooCommerce 3.0 and above. To ensure seamless payment integration, it is necessary to comply with payment regulations by whitelisting your domain. Please click on the [link](https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/developers-whitelisting) provided to whitelist your domain.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce Cashfree plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Cashfree" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now", then "Activate".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).
